# WCDANM 2024 - Neural Computing Workshop

Coordinator: Padmanabhan Seshaiyer

Department of Mathematical Sciences

College of Science, George Mason University, Fairfax, USA


## Abstract
In this short course, we will introduce foundations of computational problem solving for models and datasets associated with equations describing real world problems. We start the course with an introduction to computational thinking along with an overview of Python as a programming language. Following that, we will provide an overview of machine learning fundamentals and showcase some of the powerful state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with applications. Finally, we will build on the tools and techniques to introduce neural computing as a platform for artificial intelligence that takes advantage of the architecture of neural networks and the structure of the physical-laws governing the equations describing real-world problems to make data-driven intelligent decisions.

## Outline:

- Introduction to Computational Thinking
- Introduction to Python Basics
- Overview of Machine Learning Fundamentals
- Machine Learning Algorithms and Applications
- Introduction to Neural Computing
- Data-driven Neural Computing
